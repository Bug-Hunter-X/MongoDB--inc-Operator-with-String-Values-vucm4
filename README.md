# MongoDB $inc Operator with String Values

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The `$inc` operator is used to increment or decrement a numeric field. However, providing a string value instead of a number will lead to errors or unexpected results.

The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.js` provides the correct implementation.
